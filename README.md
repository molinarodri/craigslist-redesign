# Welcome to our craigslist-redesign repo!
We are a group of three UX/UI designers and developers taking on the challenge of redesigning Craigslist. 
In its existing design, Craigslist is a 90s themed website. User research shows that this design makes users wary of using Craigslist, citing it as "unsafe" or "sketchy." 

# Our Solution
We redesigned Craigslist to be more inviting and easy to navigate. Please see our Figma design here for more details: https://www.figma.com/file/HpMHu3QEgmjqsoTL2NZOgt/Craigslist-Redesign?node-id=2%3A4 .

# Development
We deployed craigslist-redesign as a three page glimpse into what we think would enhance the Craigslist experience. This website was developed with HTML, CSS and Flickity JS slider library. Please see https://flickity.metafizzy.co/ for more information about Flickity.
